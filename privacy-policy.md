React Query Cache Extractor does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data.

The extension operates entirely on the user’s local machine. It only interacts with React Query cache data that exists in the currently active webpage and transmits that information directly to the companion VS Code extension via a local connection (localhost). No data is sent to external servers or third-party services.

We do not track user activity, browsing behavior, or any personal information.
